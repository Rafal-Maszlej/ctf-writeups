## Hash_Chain [CRYPTO 90]

>We found a service hiding a flag! It seems to be using some kind of MD5 Hash Chain authentication to identify who is allowed to see the flag. Maybe there is a flaw you can exploit? hcexample.py has some example code on how to calculate iterations of the MD5 hash chain. Connect to it at shell2017.picoctf.com:47404!

           +++         Fibonacci challenge               +++

 [+] A fibonacci serie can be represented by the following function:

     Fn = | 0                       if N = 0
          | 1                       if N = 1
          | Fn(N - 1) + Fn(N - 2)   if N > 1

 [+] Given a N value, we want to know how many recursive calls the program do.

 [+] Example with N equal to 3

                               +-------+
                         +-----+ fib 3 +-----+
                         |     +-------+     |  
                         |                   |
                     +---+---+           +---+---+
               +-----+ fib 2 +-----+     | fib 1 +------+
               |     +-------+     |     +-------+      |
               |                   |                    |
           +---+---+           +---+---+           +----+---+
    +------+ fib 1 |    +------+ fib 0 |           | return |
    |      +-------+    |      +-------+           +--------+
    |                   |
+---+----+          +---+----+
| return |          | return |
